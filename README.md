## Overview

Feews weeks back I started learning my first programming language; Javascript. It's been....a lotðŸ˜‚. So this was project to check how far I've come and how far I still have to go.

### The challenge

You should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser
